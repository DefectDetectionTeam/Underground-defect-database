# Underground defect database
The underground target radar image database comprises measured radar images, simulated radar images, and CycleGAN-generated images. The measured radar images are collected from various subsurface hazard areas in Zhejiang, China, including urban roads and highways. All measured data were collected or sorted by the team members. The types of defects or targets include voids, cavities, pipelines, insufficient compaction, and other underground structures. This dataset is a contribution of the paper “A semi-supervised dual-path model for underground defect detection” and will be made available after the paper is published.
