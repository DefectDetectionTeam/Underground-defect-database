# Underground defect database
The underground target radar image database comprises measured radar images, simulated radar images, and CycleGAN-generated images. The measured radar images are collected from various subsurface hazard areas in Zhejiang, China, including urban roads and highways. All measured data were collected and sorted by the team members. The types of defects or targets include voids, cavities, pipelines, insufficient compaction, and other underground structures.
